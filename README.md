# Similar-Face
In this repository, we made a 3-tier web application with Django framework which finds the most similar Olympics player's face given a image of a person (just like a look-alike cam in stadiums:) ). The ML model uses PCA to extract facial features to match the most similar face in the dataset and uses KNN to cluster the data.
